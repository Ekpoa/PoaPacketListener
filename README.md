# You can only cancel/listen/broadcast packets that have already been sent
# DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN ON A NON TESTING ENVIRONMENT

Each command only needs part of the packet name to identify which, I do suggest typing the entire thing out full


Clear -> clears the cancel, listen and broadcasting list
Toggle -> turns the plugin on and off
Broadcast -> toggles whether the packet is broadcasted (note ClientboundSystemChatPacket is not sent due to recursion)
Cancel -> cancels the packet being sent/received
Listen -> only listens to packets inputted
